# Unsupervised musical explanation

Code for the unsupervised explanation of symbolic musical classifiers, as presented in the paper : "Concept-Based Techniques for ``Musicologist-friendly'' Explanations in a Deep Music Classifier", International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR), 2022.

The code is heavily based on [this](https://github.com/zhangrh93/InvertibleCE) code for the paper "Invertible Concept-based Explanations for CNN Models with Non-negative Concept Activation Vectors".
